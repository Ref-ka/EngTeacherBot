# ForWordsBot
This is my Telegram bot for convenient saving of foreign words.
The bot is currently synchronous.

The main idea of the bot is to quickly and conveniently add words, accessible via telegram. It is also assumed that the bot will be quite simple - it is not a complex multifunctional tool, but rather a small and convenient layer between the found foreign words and a more functional application for serious study. Now the bot is at an early stage of development and therefore does not fully meet the above requirements.

### The following functions are currently implemented: 
* adding words
* changing words
* deleting words
* displaying words filtered by groups and languages
* flashcards
* reminders 
* ability to export words

Words are strings, meaning you can store entire phrases or multiple words.

At the moment, the database uses only one table, which greatly limits functionality. But this is only a temporary measure for the fastest possible presentation of the concept.
